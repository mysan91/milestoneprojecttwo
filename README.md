# Memory Game

## About 
This memory was created for people who like memory games and for people who want to be able to train their memory.
The goal of this site was to build a fun and good looking game that is fun to play. 

I like memory games myself and wanted to create a game with themes that I like. 

### Creating 

I started by figuring out how I wanted the game to be structured and what different levels that would be included.

Since I myself prefer to be able to choose which level I want at each time I drive, I chose to have a menu where you can choose which level suits you best.


I decided to start with 3 different levels. The first level is with 16 cards and the second level is with 24 cards and the last is with 36 cards.


The first level is done with different programming languages and the second was with different Starwar characters. And the last one was with icons that I downloaded from Iconfinder.com


I started by building the first page and also the page with How to play the game. Then I started with level 1 and chose the pictures that would be included.
Then I built the structure of the game and made sure the page was responsive. Then I went on and did the same at level 2 and 3.
